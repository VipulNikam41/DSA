You will be given with a file which contains one integer per line. Your program should take as input the name of a file as a command-line argument. The output should be written to a file named ‘output.txt’ which should contain only 5 lines of data:

    The first line should contain the number of numbers in the file, 

    The second line should contain the minimum number present in the file

    The third line should contain the maximum number present in the file

    The fourth line should contain the sum of the numbers

    The fifth line should contain the average of numbers - upto two decimal points.


Please use either C or C++ for solving this problem.
